# AI Project-Image Captioningin Noisy Dataset

To make problem hard, there are some noisy and wrong images and captions in original data. 
Therefore, I remove those of data and fix corresponded captions. You can download image data in [here](). 

If you want to train the model, you can use
```bash
python train.py    
```
Note that there are lots of parameters. So you can try your combination.

If you want to test the model and predict the given images, you can use
```bash
python test.py 
```
